# Hypervisor network bridges
# Network bridges required on the target server (hypervisor) for VM deployment.
# On KVM, the bridges must exist as specified. The VSD needs mgmt_bridge. The
# VSC needs mgmt_bridge and data_bridge. nsgv requires the access_bridge. On
# vcenter, mgmt_bridge specifies the portgroup in vCenter to which the
# management interfaces need to be connected to, and data_bridge specifies the
# portgroup in vCenter to which the data interfaces need to be connected to.
# In vCenter/ESXi, you have virtual switches and portgroups. A virtual switch
# is similar to a normal switch, a network separation object. VMs on different
# vSwitches can not communicate directly with each other, they have to leave
# the host through the physical uplinks of the vSwitch, up to the physical
# network, to connect to each other (if the physical network is configured
# correctly). A portgroup is a sub section of a vSwitch that groups ports, this
# group of ports have the same configuration (for instance, the same VLAN, same
# security settings, â€¦). A port can only be part of one portgroup, a VM can of
# course have multiple interfaces on multiple portgroups (and a vm can have
# interfaces on portgroups that are on different vSwitches as well).
# Note that these are global network settings. Depending on the usecase, these
# variables can be defined in the specific components (myvsds, myvscs etc). If
# defined, they will overwrite the global settings.

# upgrade_vmname
# Required for upgrade, ignored otherwise: VM name to use during the
# vsd_predeploy step of an upgrade. An upgrade VM name is required on upgrade
# so that the previous version VM can be preserved for possible rollback.
# target_server_type
# Required: The type of hypervisor the VSD will be deployed on. Supported values
# are kvm, vcenter, and heat.
# target_server
# Required: The hostname or IP address of the hyervisor where this VSD will be
# instantiated.
# mgmt_ip
# The IP address of the VSDs management port.
# mgmt_gateway
# The IP address for the default gateway.
