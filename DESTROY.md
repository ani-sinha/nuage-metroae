# Removing an Existing Deployment
If you have previously deployed VSP components and would like to remove the existing deployment and start over, follow the steps below.
1. Ensure that `build_vars.yml` accurately represents your existing configuration.
2. Destroy the existing deployment with the following command:  
   `./metro-ansible destroy_everthing.yml`
3. Proceed to `BUILD.md` to review the instructions on customizing the Nuage MetroAG Ansible environment.
